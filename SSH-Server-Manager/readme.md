# SSH Server Manager

## Problem statement
 Create a Python script that allows users to interact with the system's SSH server. The script should provide functionalities to start, stop, restart, and check the status of the SSH server based on the operating system.

## Requirements
 * Python 3.x installed on the system.
 * Access to system commands for managing the SSH server based on the operating system.

## Functionalities
 1. Platform Detection
  * Detect the operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows) to perform platform-specific SSH server operations.
  
 2. SSH Server Operations
  * Start
  * Stop
  * Restart
  * Status

 3. User Interaction 
  * Display a menu to the user, allowing them to choose an operation to perform on the SSH server.
  * Provide clear instructions or messages after each operation (e.g., "SSH server started successfully," "SSH server stopped," etc.).
