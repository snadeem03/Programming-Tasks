# The Caeser Cipher Project

"The Caesar Cipher Project" is a Python project that implements the classic Caesar cipher encryption algorithm. This project allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified shift value. The Caesar cipher, named after Julius Caesar, is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

With "The Caesar Cipher Project," users can encode their messages for secure communication and decode them back to their original form. The project provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting messages, offering a seamless experience for users to protect their information while maintaining confidentiality.

## Usage/Examples

### Installation steps
* **Clone the Repository** : Clone the repository containing Caesar cipher Python application to your local machine. 

* **Navigate to the directory** :  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Python application where caesar_cipher.py is located.This is where you can find raw python file and implementation

* **Navigate to the build directory** : Navigate to the build directory under the root dir of the project where executable file would be located.


### Usage
Run the executable file using the command 

``.\caeser_cipher.exe [options] [string] [shift]``

* where options represent the encryption or decryption options 

    * -e for encryption
    * -d for decryption

* string is the message that we want to encrypt or decrypt
* shift is the amount by which each letter in the plaintext message is shifted in the alphabet to produce the corresponding ciphertext. It's also known as the "key" or "offset."
