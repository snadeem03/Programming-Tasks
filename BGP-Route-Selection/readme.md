# BGP Route Decision Engine

The BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) Route Decision Engine is a sophisticated tool designed to facilitate efficient routing decisions in large-scale network environments. Leveraging advanced algorithms and network intelligence, this engine evaluates and selects the optimal path for data packets to traverse across interconnected networks.

Key features of the BGP Route Decision Engine include:

* **Path Selection**: Analyzes various attributes such as AS_PATH, local preference, origin, and other BGP attributes to determine the best route for traffic forwarding.

* **Route Optimization**: Optimizes routing decisions to minimize latency, maximize bandwidth utilization, and enhance overall network performance.

## Usage/Examples

### Installation steps
* **Clone the Repository** : Clone the repository containing BGP Route decision engine Python application to your local machine. 

* **Navigate to the directory** :  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Python application where bgp-route-finder.py is located.This is where you can find raw python file and implementation

* **Navigate to the build directory** : Navigate to the build directory under the root dir of the project where executable file would be located.


### Usage
Run the executable file using the command 

``.\bgp-route-finder.exe [as-path_route1] [preference-value_route1] [as-path_route2] [preference-value_route2]``


* as_path : indicates the path followed from route-1 and route-2 respectively
* preference : preference value for route-1 and route-2 respectively
