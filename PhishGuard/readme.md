# PhishGuard

"PhishGuard" is an intelligent email phishing detection tool designed to enhance cybersecurity by identifying and flagging potential phishing attempts in email communications.

Using advanced algorithms, PhishGuard scans email content for suspicious patterns and URLs commonly associated with phishing attacks. It analyzes the email body for keywords and phrases often used in phishing messages, such as urgent requests, prompts to click on links, or requests for sensitive information.

Additionally, PhishGuard extracts URLs from the email content and examines them to verify their legitimacy. It checks the URL scheme (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) and domain/subdomain to determine if they align with typical patterns of legitimate URLs.
